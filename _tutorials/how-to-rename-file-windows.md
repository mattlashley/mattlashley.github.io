## Renaming a file using the "Save A Copy" feature of an application like Microsoft Word

Applications that run on Windows often provide a way to browse the file system, open a file and save it with a different name. Microsoft Word provides this feature. Follow the steps below to open a file in Microsoft Word and rename it.  

### Step 1 -- Open Microsoft Word
### Step 2 -- Click File > Open
### Step 3 -- Click File > Save A Copy


## Renaming a file from the command prompt

Windows provides a command line interface (CLI) named the Command Prompt. You can use the Command Prompt to rename a file. There are multiple ways to open a Command Prompt. This example describes one way.

Renaming a file doesn't change the file type. For example, renaming a Word file that has a .docx extension with a .xlsx extension won't convert the file from a Word file to an Excel file. Renaming a file only changes the file's name, not its contents.
