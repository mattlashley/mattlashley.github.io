Learn three ways to rename a file in Windows 10, using File Explorer, the Command Line or an application like WordPad
{: .page__subtitle}

## Introduction

Learn three methods to rename a file in Windows 10:

*  [Using Windows File Explorer](#renaming-a-file-from-file-explorer)
*  [Using the Windows Command Line](#renaming-a file-from-the-command-prompt)
*  [Using an application like WordPad](#renaming-a-file-using-the-save-as-function-of-wordpad)

Each method listed above correpsonds to a mini tutorial in this document. The On This Page menu displays this document's structure. 

## Prerequisites

This tutorial comprises three mini tutorials. To complete the steps in all three mini tutorials, you'll need:

*  a computer running Windows 10
*  some experience using Windows to perform tasks like opening applications, browsing files and typing text using a keyboard 
*  an application like WordPad

WordPad was chosen as a learning tool because it implements a file system browsing interface common to a lot of applications that run on Windows. Many computers running Windows have WordPad installed by default. If WordPad isn't installed on your computer, the concept of using the **Save As** function detailed in the tutorial will still be relevant for most Window's users.

### Step 3 -- Rename the file

Once you've located the file, there are several ways to rename it:

#### Highlight the file and press the F2 key

1.  Click the file to highlight it
2.  Press the F2 key on your keyboard
3.  Type the new name into the text box
4.  Press the Enter key on your keyboard

#### Right click the file and click the rename button

1. Right click the file name
2. Click the **Rename** button
3. Type in the new name
4. Press the Enter key on your keyboard

## Renaming a file using the Save As function of WordPad

Applications that run on Windows often provide an interface to browse the file system. You can use the interface to open a file and save it with a different name. WordPad provides this feature. Follow the steps below to open a file in WordPad and rename it.  

### Step 1 -- Open WordPad
### Step 2 -- Click File > Open
### Step 3 -- Click File > Save As


## Renaming a file from the command prompt

Windows provides a command line interface (CLI) named the Command Prompt. You can use the Command Prompt to rename a file. There are multiple ways to open a Command Prompt. This example describes one way.

Renaming a file doesn't change the file type. For example, renaming a Word file that has a .docx extension with a .xlsx extension won't convert the file from a Word file to an Excel file. Renaming a file only changes the file's name, not its contents.
