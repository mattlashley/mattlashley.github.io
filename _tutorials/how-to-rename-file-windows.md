Learn three ways to rename a file in Windows 10, using File Explorer, the Command Line, and an application like WordPad
{: .page__subtitle}

## Introduction

Windows 10 provides multiple ways to renmame files. This tutorial walks through three of them:

1.  [Using Windows File Explorer](#renaming-a-file-from-file-explorer)
2.  [Using the Windows Command Line](#renaming-a file-from-the-command-prompt)
3.  [Using an application like WordPad](#renaming-a-file-using-the-save-as-function-of-wordpad)

The file metaphor was adopted early in the development of computer systems. Much like the paper based namesake that hold sets of papers, a computer file holds sets of electronic data. And just like a paper based files, an eleltronic file can be labelled or named, allowing us to identify the file future reference.

### Prerequisites

To complete the steps in all three mini tutorials, you'll need:

*  a computer running Windows 10
*  some experience using Windows to perform tasks like opening applications, browsing files and typing text using a keyboard 
*  an application like WordPad

If WordPad isn't installed on your computer, you won't be able to follow the tutorial step by step. However, the **Save As** and **Save File As** functions detailed in the third tutorial are standard functions found in many Windows applications.

### Step 3 -- Rename the file

Once you've located the file, there are several ways to rename it:

#### Highlight the file and press the F2 key

1.  Click the file to highlight it
2.  Press the F2 key on your keyboard
3.  Type the new name into the text box
4.  Press the Enter key on your keyboard

#### Right click the file and click the rename button

1. Right click the file name
2. Click the **Rename** button
3. Type in the new name
4. Press the Enter key on your keyboard

## Renaming a file using the Save As function of WordPad

Applications that run on Windows often provide an interface to browse the file system. You can use the interface to open a file and save it with a different name. WordPad provides this feature. Follow the steps below to open a file in WordPad and rename it.  

### Step 1 -- Open WordPad
### Step 2 -- Click File > Open
### Step 3 -- Click File > Save As


## Renaming a file from the command prompt

Windows provides a command line interface (CLI) named the Command Prompt. You can use the Command Prompt to rename a file. There are multiple ways to open a Command Prompt. This example describes one way.

Renaming a file doesn't change the file type. For example, renaming a Word file that has a .docx extension with a .xlsx extension won't convert the file from a Word file to an Excel file. Renaming a file only changes the file's name, not its contents.
